# Acoustic Data Processing
IoT sensors are frequently equiped with microphones which can capture acoustic signals from the environment. These signals contain a lot of information which can be extracted by combining digital signal processing and machine learning.

Here we will describe the steps necessary to work with acoustic signals and demonstrate the application of acoustic processing in two applications: 1) ecosystems monitoring for conservation and 2) traffic monitoring.


## Acoustic Ecosytstem Monitoring


## Acoustic Road Traffic Monotoring




## Acoustic Data Processing

Before describing the applications, we will go through general steps in working with audio signals. These steps are descibed in the notebook `audio-processing.ipynb`. To be able to run the notebook,
do the following

1. Clone this repository and cd into it
1. Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
`python3 -m venv audio-env`
1. Activate it
On Linux
`source audio-env/bin/activate`
On Windows
`audio-env\Scripts\activate.bat`
1. Update pip `pip install --upgrade pip`
1. Install the requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Once this is done launch the notebook.
